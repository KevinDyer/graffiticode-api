<b>Introducing Graffiti Code [Preview Release]</b>
</p>
<p>
Graffiti Code is currently available as a Preview Release. This means that it is suitable for
doing demos and using along well documented paths. This includes all the ways explained in the
"How To" tutorial, and browsing and modifying pieces in the archive.
</p>
<p>
The greatest value of this release is to give a sense of what Graffiti Code will become as a
language and environment for doing one thing well, drawing with code. With a little imagination, we
can see how the optimized user experience of finding, writing and sharing code -- without the usual
burden of complexity that comes with installing, configuring and maintaining a collection of general
purpose programming tools -- will go a long ways to making programming accessible to just about
everyone.
</p>
<p>
An important part of this optimizing is in the language design of Graffiti Code. We want the
language to provide the benefits of early errors and context sensitive hints and help. For this we
have chosen a statically typed functional language based on ML, but with very lightweight syntax.
Our premise is that intelligent people don't have trouble understanding powerful abstractions. What
they have trouble with is complexity that doesn't have obvious meaning. For this reason we have
chosen to take the powerful abstraction of functions and use it to provide as much access as
possible to both machine and drawing semantics. We avoid imperitive statements in favor of
expressions that support iteration and branching. It remains to be seen how accessible these
techniques will be to ordinary users of the language, but we remain hopeful and determined to take
this paradigm as far as it will go.
</p>

<p>
Amoung the greatest pitfalls of this release will be performance, unimplemented language features,
context sensitive hints and help, and lack of archive filtering. These are all things that are on
the top of our todo list. To avoid these disappointments, we suggest that you start pieces in the
archive, stay within the documented paths, and be patient finding your way through the archive.

else you want us to know.
