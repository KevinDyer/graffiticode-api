<h1>Getting started</h1>
<br>
<p>

In this tutorial you will learn five basic skills for using Graffiti Code. If you are familiar with
other drawing languages such as PostScript or Processing, then this will mostly be review for you.
But even so, the syntax and editing environment will be different and there are other more subtle
differences, so you will benefit from working through this tutorial.
</p>
<p>
The five skill you will learn here are:<br>

</ul>

<h1>Preparing the drawing surface</h1>
<br>
<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: Graffiti Code programs consist of sequences of expressions. The
expressions we will be using in this section are called function applications. You may remember from
high school math class that a function is an equation (or procedure) that maps a set of values to
one or more other values. Graffiti Code functions that interest us most are the ones that return
values representing marks on a surface or somehow affect the surface visually.
</p>
<p>
Graffiti Code provides two functions that affect the drawing surface. They are <b>size</b> and
<b>background</b>. The <b>size</b> function takes two number values that represent the width and height
of the drawing surface in pixels. The <b>background</b> function takes a single value that represents the color of
the background. In this case we are giving it the integer value <i>127</i>, which represents a 50% gray value.
</p>
<p> <b>NOTE</b>: Color values can be represented by integer values between <i>0</i> and <i>255</i>,
inclusive, where <i>0</i> represents black and <i>255</i> represents white. Non-grey color values can be computed using one of the functions: <b>rgb</b> or <b>rgba</b>,
to be discussed later.
</p>

<p>
<div id="surface-example-editor"/>
</p>

<p>
As seen below, this code sets the drawing surface size to <i>100</i> pixels wide by <i>100</i> pixels high, and sets
its color to roughly 50% gray.

<p>
<div id="surface-example-graffito"></div>
</p>

<p>
<a onclick="GraffitiCode.ui.showWorkspace(); GraffitiCode.ui.updateSrc(252)">View in editor.</a>
</p>

<h1>Making shapes</h1>
<br>
<p>


<script>
$(document).ready(function () {
    editor = CodeMirror(document.querySelector("#surface-example-editor"), {
	mode:  "graffiti",
	lineWrapping: "true",
	lineNumbers: "true",
        value: "size 100 100.\nbackground 127.\n.",
        readOnly: true,
    })

    $.get("http://www.graffiticode.org/graffiti/252", function (data) {
        $("#surface-example-graffito").append("<a>"+data+"</a>")
    })


})
