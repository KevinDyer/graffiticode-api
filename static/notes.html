<b>What Code Means</b>
</p>
<p>
Code has meaning that is realized when it is set in motion at a particular time
and in a particular place. When we write code we take a problem off the space/time grid and move
it into a meta world where space and time are made. There we are able to simulate the rules of the
real world and work with them without being subject to them.

<b>Preview Release</b>
</p>
<p>
Graffiti Code is currently available as a <b>Preview Release</b>. This means that it is suitable for
doing demos and using along well documented paths.
</p>
<p>
The greatest disappointments in this release will probably have to do with performance, unimplemented
language features, and lack of archive filtering. We sugguest that you start small, stay within the
documented path, and be patient scrolling through however many pieces are found in the archive.
</p>
<p>
Send mail to <b>feedback@graffiticode.org</b> if you have an issue you want prioritied.
</p>
<p>
Happy coding!
