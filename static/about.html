<h1>About Graffiti Code</h1>

<p>
<b>Graffiti Code</b> is a web application developed by

</a>
that enables people of all backgrounds and interests to draw with code. Graffiti Code takes the best
of programming language and environment design to provide an integrated online experience focused on
doing that one thing well. In doing so it eliminates the need for users to acquire general
programming skills to be productive at writing code. All that they need to know about programming
can be learned by using Graffiti Code. At least that is our goal.

<p>

In order to make reading, writing and remixing code fun and productive there are practical problems
of access, learning, and sharing that need to be solved. Users must be able to find examples of
work that interests them, and they need to have the right to reuse and remix that code without fear
of violating copyright laws. Old code needs to keep working even when the language it is written in
has changed, or when external code that it depends on has been modified. The language code is
written in must be learnable and powerful enough to be useful for doing real work. The
writing environment needs to be efficient and provide immediate feedback so that users can
correct issues as they type. Works in progress need to be archived so that alternative paths of
creativity can be pursued spontaneously, and finished pieces need to be easily shared. And finally,
licensing has to be taken care of so that writers are given credit when it is due.

<p>

Solving this broad set of problems involves many details. Here is a partial list of Graffiti Code
features that contribute to their solutions:

<h1>The web as a platform</h1>

<p>

<br>

The web is a rich platform for creating and distributing visual content. It's
very fabric is a complex network of languages that describe the graphics, texts
and behaviors that are experienced through the browser.

<p>

There are many way to express oneself with text on the web, and there are also
graphical drawing tools for creating images on the web. There are even
programming environments built arounds languages like Processing that allow you
to write code that draws, animates and interacts for the web. Graffiti Code is
different than those tools in that it is a language and environment that is
specialized for the task of finding, remixing, and sharing visual content on and
for the web.

<h1>Code as a visual medium</h1>

<p>
<br>

There are, of course, many ways to create graphics using visual tools. Applications
such as Photoshop and Illustrator have a wide and deep user base among professional
and amateur designers and artist. But because of the graphically oriented work flows,
these tools lack the conveniences and power of working directly in code.

<p>

Conventional programming languages obscure the fact that writing code can be
cognitively similar to writing descriptions of real or imagined things using
natural language, or for those comfortable with math, writing equations using
functions. These are ways of expressing that we learn throughout our formal K-12
education.

<p>

While programming languages can be much more complex, for the purposes of drawing
with code, they need not be. With Graffiti Code we stay within the familiar bounds
of formal description learned by all high school graduates. 
<p>

<h1>Essential Features</h1>

<p>
<br>

Graffiti Code integrates three major features to make the creative process
fluid and enaging: 1/finding interesting pieces through the environment and
in the wild; 2/learning and using language to create new art; 3/sharing
work with others.

<h2>Finding pieces</h2>

<p>
Pieces are found by searching the Graffiti Code database, much like you search Google Images.
The user can search for meta data, or similarity to other pieces, or by relative number of
votes of images.

<h2>Reading, writing and remixing</h2>

<p>
Programs are written in languages designed to enble people to communicate with a machines and each other.
Languages are living artifacts of this communication process. Successful languages (human and computer)
have an innate ability to evolve to transmit new meanings between speaker/programmer and listener/machine.

<p>

At the core of the creative coding process is a language that allows a creator to describe a creation.
To be effective, such a language should have a vocabulary that fits closely with the vocabulary of the
writer. If this is not the case, then the writing process is slowed by the need to reword ideas in the
dissonent vocabulary.

<p>

In Graffiti Code we address this need by narrowing vocabularies to specific domains of use (e.g. drawing web assets),
and by allowing users to easily define new words.

<p>

A program is a sequence of expressions that each draw on the canvas. Each expression consists of a shape constructor
(e.g. rectangle, triangle, ellipse) and zero or more modifiers of the result shape value (e.g. color, rotate, and
translate).

<p>

Parts of programs can be given names to create new words (e.g. "let blue-circle d = color blue ellipse d d..")

<p>

Then language is light in syntax, like most natural languages, including english, favoring words to express core
meanings such as control flow.

<p>

<h2>Sharing and distributing work</h2>
<p><br>



<h1>Clippings</h1>

<p>

People have been expresssing themselves visually since before they had language to express themselves.
And until post modern art emerged in the last half of the 200th century, all art was based on non-linguistic
non-notational creative processes. Early computational art and post-modern serial art, in their own ways
explored the space of visual expression through language. The interest and importance of code based art has
grown expoentially ever sense.
