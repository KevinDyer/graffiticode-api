<h1>Getting started</h1>
<br>
<p>

In this tutorial you will learn five basic skills for using Graffiti Code. If you are familiar with
other drawing languages such as PostScript or Processing, then this will mostly be review for you.
But even so, the syntax and editing environment will be different and there are other more subtle
differences, so you will benefit from working through this tutorial.
</p>
<p>
The five skill you will learn here are:<br>

</ul>

<h1>Preparing the drawing surface</h1>
<br>
<p>
<i><b>Basic knowledge</b>: Graffiti Code programs consist of sequences of expressions. The
expressions we will be using in this section are called function applications. You may remember from
high school math class that a function is an equation (or procedure) that maps a set of values to
one or more other values. Graffiti Code functions that interest us most are the ones that return
values representing marks on a surface or somehow affect the surface visually.</i>
</p>
<p>
Graffiti Code provides two functions that affect the drawing surface. They are <b>size</b> and
<b>background</b>: <b>size</b> set the size of the drawing surface; <b>background</b> sets the
background color of the drawing surface.

<p>
<div id="surface-example-editor"/>
</p>

<p>
As seen below, this code configures the drawing surface 100 pixels wide by 100 pixels high, and colors it at roughly
50% gray.

<p>
<div id="surface-example-graffito"></div>
</p>

<script>
$(document).ready(function () {
    editor = CodeMirror(document.querySelector("#surface-example-editor"), {
	mode:  "graffiti",
	lineWrapping: "true",
	lineNumbers: "true",
        value: "size 100 100.\nbackground 127.\n.",
        readOnly: true,
    })

    $.get("http://www.graffiticode.org/graffiti/252", function (data) {
        $("#surface-example-graffito").append("<a>"+data+"</a>")
    })


})
