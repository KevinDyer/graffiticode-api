<h1>About Graffiti Code</h1>

<br>
<p>
<b>Graffiti Code</b> is an experiment in drawing with code. The idea of drawing
with code is not new of course. It has been around as long as code has been
around. What we are trying to do with Graffiti Code is to boil the drawing
process down to its essential steps, to make the tools as simple and efficient
as possible, to remove all unnecessary blocks between artist and drawing.

<p>
<b>Graffiti Code</b> consists primarily of a language, a workspace and an
archive.

<p>
The <b>language</b> of Graffiti Code is functional and statically typed, with
minimal syntax. References to user definitions are folded at authoring time to
produce a graph that consists of primitive values and constraints which are
interpreted to generate a drawing.

<p>
The <b>workspace</b> includes an editor and a viewer. When the code in the
editor is valid, the drawing in the viewer is updated. When the code is invalid,
immediate and specific feedback is provided. At least this is our goal along
with providing code completion, constant scrubbing and other modern editor
conveniences.

<p>
The <b>archive</b> displays stored drawings. Stored drawings can be edited and
viewed in a separate window. Editing an archived drawing creates a fork of the
original. Each archived drawing has a unique URL so can be embedded elsewhere
on the web.

<p>
Click around the archive to see what has been done. If you feel lucky, login
with <b>Persona</b> and try writing some code yourself. Beware though, the only
help we currently offer is what you can gleen from the archive. Oh, and we
recommend using a recent version of <b>Firefox</b>. (Something to do with a bug
in Webkit while positioning LaTeX objects embedded in SVG, in case you are
wondering.)
