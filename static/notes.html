<p>
Graffiti Code is currently available as a <b>Preview Release</b>. This means that it is suitable for
doing demos and using along well documented paths.
</p>
<p>
The greatest disappointments in this release will probably have to do with performance, unimplemented
language features, and lack of archive filtering. We sugguest that you start small, stay within the
documented path, and be patient scrolling through however many pieces are found in the archive.
</p>
<p>
Send mail to <b>feedback@graffiticode.org</b> if you have an issue you want prioritied.
</p>
<p>
Happy coding!
