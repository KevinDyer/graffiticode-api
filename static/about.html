<h1>About Graffiti Code</h1>

<br>
<p>
<b>Graffiti Code</b> is an experiment in drawing with code. It consists
primarily of a workspace, a language and an archive.

<p>
The <b>workspace</b> includes an editor and a viewer. When the code in the
editor is valid language, it is interpreted and the drawing in the viewer is
updated.

<p>
The <b>language</b> of Graffiti Code is functional and statically typed with
minimal syntax. References to user definitions (keyword 'let') are folded at
authoring time to produce a graph that consists of expressions of primitive
values and operations. This graph is interpreted to generate a drawing.

<p>
The <b>archive</b> displays saved drawings. Saved drawings can be edited or 
viewed in a new browser window. Editing an existing drawing creates a fork of
the original. Each archived drawing is an HTML document with an unique URL.

<p>
Click around the archive to see what has been done. If you feel lucky, login
with <b>Persona</b> and try writing some code yourself. Beware though, the only
help we currently offer is what you can gleen from the archive. Oh, and we
recommend using a recent version of <b>Firefox</b>. (Something to do with a bug
in Webkit while positioning LaTeX objects embedded in SVG, in case you are
wondering.)
