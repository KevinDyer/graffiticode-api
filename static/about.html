<h1>About Graffiti Code</h1>

<br>
<p>
<b>Graffiti Code</b> is a coding environment for synthesizing form. It is
experimental and currently hard to decode as no documentation is provided. If
you are curious, you can click around the <i>Archive</i> to see some of our
experiments. If you are feeling lucky, you can login with <i>Persona</i> and
try coding some yourself. Beware though, the only help we can offer is the
hints you can gleen from the code in the archive. Oh, and we recommend using an
recent version of <i>Firefox</i>.
